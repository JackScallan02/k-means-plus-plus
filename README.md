# k-means-plus-plus
Implementation of the K-means++ algorithm from scratch

# How to view
To view the raw implementation, preview the `kmeans.py` to see the code and `Clustering.ipynb` file to see the graphed visual representations and error calculations.
To view how PCA was applied, preview the `PCA.ipynb` file to see the code and a graphed visual representation.

# The implementation
To implement the K-means++ algorithm, I used Python. I found the initial centers in the `k_init` function and I implemented the K-means algorithm in the following functions. Finally, I computed the objective in `compute_objective`.
